outofheapmemory error

TODAY ASSIGNMENT

1)Responsibility of develepor to handle the outofheapmemory error?
	we have to increase heap memory but when the application is running then we have to stop the server in the maintaince period and then increase the 		memory.

2)string pool - String pool is nothing but a storage area in Java heap where string literals stores. 
	It is also known as String Intern Pool or String Constant Pool.
	By default, it is empty and privately maintained by the Java String class. 
	Whenever we create a string the string object occupies some space in the heap memory
	The JVM performs some steps during the initialization of string literals that increase the performance and decrease the 					memory load
	When we create a string literal, the JVM first check that literal in the String pool. 
	If the literal is already present in the pool, it returns a reference to the pooled instance. 
	If not present in the pool, a new String object takes place in the String pool.
				
3)Memory Leakage - the memory leak is a situation when the garbage collector does not recognize the unused objects 
		and they remain in the memory indefinitely that reduces the amount of memory allocated to the application. 
		Because the unused objects still being referenced that may lead to OutOfMemoryError. 
		It also affects the reliability of the application.
4)How to avoid memory leakage - there are 2 ways
		1) Quick fix: Eclipse Memory Leak warning/errors.
		eclipse will throw a warning at you if its reference is destroyed but the object is not closed. 
		However, the leak-detection isn't always enabled in eclipse projects. You might have to turn them on first.
		2) Manually disable & enable parts of your code and observe memory usage of your JVM using a JVM tool 							like VisualVM.
					
5)java memory model - The Metaspace(5) is used to store the metadata about your loaded classes in the JVM. 
		 Prior to Java 8, the structure of the memory was a bit different. 
		The metaspace is called actually the PermGen		
						
6)what changes done in java8 for memory management
	Oracle has completely gotten rid of ‘PermGen’ and replaced it with Metaspace.
	PermGen is the memory area in Heap that is used by the JVM to store class and method objects
	 PermGen space is configured by the Java command line option -XX:MaxPermSize
	 
	 The key difference between PermGen and Metaspace is this: 
	 while PermGen is part of Java Heap (Maximum size configured by -Xmx option), Metaspace is NOT part of Heap. 
	 Rather Metaspace is part of Native Memory (process memory).
	 
7)root causes for outofmemory error
	OutOfMemoryError is a runtime error in Java which occurs when the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is unable to allocate 
	an object due to insufficient space in the Java heap. ... 
	This error can also be thrown when the native memory is insufficient to support the loading of a Java class
